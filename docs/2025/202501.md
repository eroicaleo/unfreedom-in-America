**Musk takes over the treasury department.**

David Lebryk (Acting Secretary of the Treasury of the United States),
who has carried out senior nonpolitical roles at the department for decades, is leaving after officials on Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, sought access to Treasury’s payment system.

* What is the payment system and why the payment system is important?
    * From WaPo: it is a sensitive system that controls the flow of more than 6 trillion to households, business and more nationwide. Hundreds of millions of people rely on the system which distribute SS and Medicare benefits, salaries for federal personnel and payments to government contractors and grant recipients and tax refunds.
* Legitimacy of his action.
    * Heather quoted political scientist Seth Masket: "Elon Musk is not a federal employee, nor has he been appointed by the President nor approved by the Senate to have any leadership role in government. The ‘Department of Government Efficiency,’ announced by Trump in a January 20th executive order, is not truly any sort of government department or agency, and even the executive order uses quotes in the title. ... DOGE does not have power over established government agencies, and Musk has no role in government. It does not matter that he is an ally of the President. Musk is a private citizen taking control of established government offices. That is not efficiency; that is a coup."
* The purpose of this action:
    * Greg Sargent quote Michael Linden: The only reason Musk wants to get himself in there must be because he wants to turn some things off.
* The consequence of this action:
    * Greg Sargent: it could potentially give DOGE the power to turn off all kinds of government payments in a targeted way.
* What is Lebryk's role:
    * Close monitoring the debt ceiling crisis.
    * He and his team determines on what date it will no longer be able to meet its obligations.
    * Warn the congress.
    * We we want career, nonpolitical civil servants to be in charge of this really complicated shit.
    * We want the process to be administered in a totally nonpoliticized way.
    * He and career officials protect the systems and the full faith and credit of the United States from political interference.
